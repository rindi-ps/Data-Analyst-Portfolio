## Challenges I Overcame
- **Messy, Missing data** → Cleaned with Pandas: handle nulls, outliers, duplicates.  
- **Complex SQL JOINs & CTEs** → Practiced across real business cases until fluent.  
- **Poor visual storytelling** → Improved with better chart choices & business context.  
- **Interpreting business needs** → Trained to always align insights with objectives.
