## Modules & Skills Learned
- During my learning journey at Growia, I explored both technical and business-oriented skills through the following modules:

### Introduction to Data Analysis  
- Developed a strong foundation in the data analysis workflow, understanding the distinct roles within a data team (Data Engineer, Data Analyst, Data Scientist, and Machine Learning Engineer).  
- Learned to identify the needs of various industries—including Retail, Finance, and Creative sectors—for data analysis in decision-making.  
- Gained insight into key responsibilities of a Data Analyst, such as exploring business questions, working with structured data, generating insights, and presenting findings through effective data visualization.  
- Acquired essential skills, including programming (Python, SQL), data visualization, critical thinking, business acumen, and communication.  

### Key Business Metrics
- Learned to differentiate between business metrics and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), and how to align them with business goals. Studied key metrics across departments (Marketing, Supply Chain, HR, etc.), and how to measure customer satisfaction, employee performance, and financial health using industry-standard KPIs.
- Explored the four stages of analytics (descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, prescriptive), with a focus on descriptive and diagnostic analytics relevant to Data Analysts.
- Practiced identifying relevant metrics for various professions and applied tools such as Tableau, Google Data Studio, and Power BI to monitor KPIs more effectively than traditional tools like Excel.

### Statistics for Data Analysis
- Studied descriptive statistics such as measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode) and data dispersion (range, variance, standard deviation, IQR).
- Learned how to analyze and interpret data distributions, including boxplots and pairplots, and applied statistical concepts to support business decision-making.

### Data Analysis with Excel  
- Learned essential Excel features to support data analysis, including data cleaning, formatting, and formula-based calculations.  
- Applied **text functions** (e.g., LEFT, RIGHT, MID, CONCAT), **mathematical functions** (e.g., SUM, AVERAGE, ROUND), **logical functions** (e.g., IF, AND, OR), and **lookup functions** (e.g., VLOOKUP, HLOOKUP).  
- Built Pivot Tables and visualizations to summarize insights and communicate findings effectively.

### SQL and Database  
- Learned the fundamentals of SQL including basic queries (SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY), joins, aggregations, and subqueries.  
- Applied SQL skills to solve real business cases by extracting insights from structured datasets using relational databases.

### SQL with Google BigQuery  
- Learned the fundamentals of BigQuery, including its structure, syntax, and setup for large-scale data analysis.  
- Performed data extraction and transformation using SQL queries with **SELECT, JOIN, CTEs, Aggregation, Filtering, HAVING**, and **Subqueries** on cloud-based datasets.

### Python Programming  
- Learned the fundamentals of Python including variables, data types, loops, and functions. Explored essential libraries such as Pandas for data manipulation and Matplotlib/Seaborn for basic data visualization.

### Data Visualization with Google Looker Studio
- Learned the fundamentals of data visualization, including its purpose, best practices, and how to choose effective chart types based on data context.

### Visualization with Tableau
- Built interactive and exploratory dashboards, utilizing features like parameters, filters, and calculated fields.

### Practical Data Analytics for Marketing and Sales  
- Applied data analytics to marketing scenarios, including customer acquisition funnel analysis and customer segmentation using RFM and K-Means clustering methods.

### Final Project & Portfolio Development
- Integrated all the acquired skills to complete a comprehensive analysis project—from data cleaning to business insights and presentation.

## Challenges & Solutions
Throughout the project development, I encountered several challenges and tackled them as follows:

### Dataset is not clean
→ I addressed this by performing thorough data cleaning using Pandas, including handling missing values, duplicates, and outliers.

### Challenge in Learning SQL: Mastering JOINs, CTEs, and Data Relationships
→ One of the biggest challenges in learning SQL is understanding how different tables are connected. I had to truly grasp the use of JOINs—starting from INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, to FULL OUTER JOIN—and ensure that each row of data matches correctly. On top of that, writing CTEs (Common Table Expressions) required layered logic to keep queries efficient and readable. Turning raw data into insight is not just about writing queries, but also about understanding data relationships and thinking like a 'data detective'—searching for pieces of information from multiple sources.

### Interpreting insights in a relevant business context
→ I trained myself to always align analysis outcomes with business objectives and deliver actionable recommendations.

### Ineffective data visualizations
→ Resolved by choosing the right chart types, applying proper color schemes and labels to ensure insights are easily understood by non-technical stakeholders.
