## Challenges & Solutions
Throughout the project development, I encountered several challenges and tackled them as follows:

### Messy and inconsistent data
→ I addressed this by performing thorough data cleaning using Pandas, including handling missing values, duplicates, and outliers.

### Large dataset and complex SQL queries
→ Solved by using Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to make SQL queries more modular, organized, and easier to maintain.

### Interpreting insights in a relevant business context
→ I trained myself to always align analysis outcomes with business objectives and deliver actionable recommendations.

### Ineffective data visualizations
→ Resolved by choosing the right chart types, applying proper color schemes and labels to ensure insights are easily understood by non-technical stakeholders.
